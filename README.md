## NLP & Network Analysis of Witcher Series

Built a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline with spaCy to extract named entities from The Witcher book series and identify character mentions across over 80,000 sentences.

Constructed character relationship networks using NetworkX and co-occurrence windows, analyzing structural properties such as degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality to determine the most influential characters.

Applied community detection algorithms (Louvain method) to uncover narrative clusters and social groupings within the text.

Developed a temporal network analysis to track the evolution of major characters’ importance across multiple books, visualizing changes with Matplotlib and PyVis interactive graphs.

Project was built in conjunction with instruction provided by https://github.com/thu-vu92
